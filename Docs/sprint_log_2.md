# Sprint 2 â€“ Persistence and Menu CLI

## Sprint goal

To enhance the MortgageBuddy application by adding file saving and loading of loan sessions in plain text format and implementing a menu-based command-line interface (CLI) to improve user interaction. Additional refinements were made to user prompts and output formatting.

---

## Tasks completed

- Implemented file saving of loan session data to a `.txt` file
- Implemented file loading of loan session data from a `.txt` file
- Developed a menu-based CLI with options to:
  1. Create a new loan calculation
  2. View the most recently saved loan
  3. Exit the application
- Refined program output formatting with clear headings and spacing
- Updated input prompts for clarity and precision
- Conducted manual testing to confirm functionality
- Committed changes incrementally using Git for version tracking

---

## Resources used

- Python standard library functions for file handling (`open`, `read`, `write`)
- Python standard input and output functions
- Sprint 1 class implementations carried forward as the application base
- AI assistance used for structuring the menu loop and integrating persistence logic

## Version control

- All Sprint 2 changes implemented on the `sprint-2` branch
- Incremental commits with descriptive messages after each functional milestone
- Added persistence methods to `Calculator.py`
- Updated `main.py` to call the new menu loop
- Branch pushed to remote repository after testing completion

## Reflections

The introduction of plain text persistence enables quick storage and retrieval of loan session data without external dependencies.  
The menu-based CLI allows for efficient navigation and reduces program restarts.  
Output formatting improvements increase clarity and professionalism.  
Sprint 3 will focus on user authentication, extended menu options, and automated unit testing.
